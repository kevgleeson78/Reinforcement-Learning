	Abstract = {The author discusses the advances in artificial intelligence and robotics that will substantially affect the changing economic systems. He says that implications of today's accelerating information technology must be different from past innovations. He adds that technology does not have to result in job destruction right away in order to produce substantial unemployment in the future.},

	Abstract = {The article discusses debate about the development of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use artificial intelligence (AI). Topics include the anti-LAWS coalition Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, the opinions of robot researcher Ronald Arkin, and the possibility of an international agreement on LAWS under the United Nations (U.N.) protocol Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCCW). The views of philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel on the ethical implications of AI in warfare are noted.},
